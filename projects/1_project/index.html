Applying a holistic, interdisciplinary, and problem-solving approach, Age-It overcomes the fragmentation of different perspectives on ageing, involving a critical mass of partners including research and educational institutions, care providers and civil society associations, businesses and industries.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Age_it_Vision-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Age_it_Vision-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Age_it_Vision-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/Age_it_Vision.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Age-It (photo 3)" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Age-It Vision.

These challenges are intertwined with the Silver Economy (i.e., work, participation and welfare at older ages, but also new consumption and activity models) (#6) and with the political and cultural dimensions of an ageing society (#7).</p> <p>The thematic challenges are systematically integrated by three additional cross-integration challenges: the importance of interventions and technologies to reduce the burden of age-related diseases, disorders and disabilities (#8), the technological developments towards meeting the (new) needs of older people (#9), as well as the overall mainstreaming and re-thinking of ageing-related policy-making (#10).</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Age_it_Challenges-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Age_it_Challenges-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Age_it_Challenges-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/Age_it_Challenges.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Age-It challenges" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/11-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/11-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/11-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Age-It (photo 4)" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Age-it - Cross integration (vertical) challanges.

This programme acknowledges the dynamic nature of ageing through a holistic view by adopting a life course approach at the individual and family level and for society as a whole. Three life course principles in particular provide the foundation of our holistic approach:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cumulative contingencies</strong> (previous experiences shape a person’s current status)</li> <li> <strong>Linked lives</strong> (events in one domain of a person’s life influence all of their other domains)</li> <li> <strong>Historical time period</strong> (the period in which individuals live moderates the timing and sequencing of key life course transitions)</li> </ul> <p>Micro-level (individuals), meso-level (e.g., households, care providers, volunteering organizations, and firms) and macro-level (society, institutions) are all pivotal.</p> </body></html>
