The RETIN project aims at conducting applied research on chronic diseases, treatment patterns, costs, and outcomes. The RETIN project will analyze chronic diseases variations in terms of geography and socio-demographic conditions by comparing three among the biggest Italian regions, namely Tuscany, Lombardy, and Sicily. The RETIN project will focus on four key areas:

1) Identification of common methods for a detailed examination of the current burden of chronicity through the use of administrative care databases and other publicly available information.
2) Comparison of differences within and between the three regions.
3) Analysis of socio-economic and contextual determinants on prevalence, costs, and outcome.
4) Lesson learnt and policy summary with the aim of building a common template for the adoption of a uniform definition of NCDs at the national level.
