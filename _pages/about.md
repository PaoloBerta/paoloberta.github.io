I am Full Professor of Public Economics at the [Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods](https://www.dismeq.unimib.it/it), University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy.

My research focuses on health economics, statistical evaluation of healthcare systems, policy evaluation, and the application of modern econometric and statistical methods to administrative data. A crucial aspect of my work is the use of administrative data at regional and national levels, allowing me to leverage population-level data while overcoming the limitations of survey-based datasets.

My research has developed through competitive grants, institutional assignments, and independently initiated projects with regional, national, and international significance. Current projects include [Age-it](https://ageit.eu) (PNRR) and Responses To Inequalities in Non-communicable diseases: measurement and management challenges through an
inter-regional perspectives [RETIN](https://prin-retin.github.io).
